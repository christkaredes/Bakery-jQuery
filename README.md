# Bakery-jQuery
This is a project that has a drag and drop cart with removable items. After submiting items, you are taken to a survey which asks some questions using radio buttons and a textbox. If any survey questions are skipped, the user will be notified that they are missing some survey items. There is also an HTML page for ingredients page which loads HTML pages inside the brown box using AJAX.
